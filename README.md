# student-info-system


Project Overview

This is a console-based Student Information System implemented in C programming language. It allows users to add, display, search, update, and delete student records efficiently. The system is designed to be menu-driven, making it user-friendly and easy to navigate.

The project demonstrates key programming concepts including:

Structures to store and organize student data.
Arrays for managing multiple student records.
CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on records.
Input handling techniques to read names with spaces and manage invalid inputs.

Purpose

The goal of this project is to provide a practical learning tool for beginners to understand how data can be stored, managed, and manipulated in C using fundamental concepts. It simulates a real-world scenario of managing student information in small-scale educational environments.

Key Features

Add new students with details: roll number, name, age, and percentage.
Display all student records in a structured format.
Search for a student by roll number.
Update student information easily.
Delete student records and maintain sequential roll numbers.
Provides a clear and interactive menu interface for smooth operation.
Skills Demonstrated
C programming basics: variables, loops, conditionals.
Structured programming using structures and arrays.
Implementing menu-driven console applications.
Managing CRUD operations effectively in memory.
Proper input validation and handling of newline characters.
